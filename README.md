mastery:
comprehensive knowledge or skill in a particular subject or activity.

it takes 1000 hours to gain the title of master in any activity.

beginner --> intermediate --> expert --> competent --> master

To reach the next milestone one must spend a total of 250 hours in that subject.

every week of inactivity towards that activity will drop your accumelated time on that activity by 0.5 hour.

Badges are valid for a year and after that you drop a rank and will be addresses as familliar with that topic with the previous badge.
